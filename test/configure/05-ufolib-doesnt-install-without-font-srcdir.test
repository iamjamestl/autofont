# When configuring a project that does not have font sources, when ufoLib is
# missing and the `--enable-build-dependencies` argument is passed, configure
# will not install ufoLib.
#
# Note, we can't very accurately test this behavior on systems that already
# have ufoLib installed.
#

# Include a set of common test functions
source "$HELPERS"

# Check test environment
if python -c 'import ufoLib' 2>/dev/null; then
    exit "$SKIP"

# Establish expectations
expected_have_pymod_ufolib='no'

# Perform the action under test
configure --enable-build-dependencies

# Read the results
